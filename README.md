Hi!
I used DDD with observer design pattern. And I also used sockets for communication. When new message will be delivered, it automatically triggers its observers.
Firstly start MessageReceiverApplication and then start MessageSenderApplication.
And select reply mode from MessageSenderApplication.
It will init a random number and send to receiverPlayer. 
Choose your options to reply back (1 ,0 or -1).
Calculated number will be sending back to sender; and it will repeat until one of them will reach number 1.
Enjoy!
